         * 
         * Insertion sort will only compare the previous element for each element in the array, 
         * where selection sort will need to go thorugh the whole array for each element and see if there exist an element that is smaller.

         * Which method runs faster for an array in reverse order, selection sort or insertion sort?
         * 
         * Selection sort because even though both selection sort and insertion sort will run in quadratic time, 
         * selection sort will only make N exchanges, while insertion sort will make N^2 / 2 exchanges.

         * 
         * 
         * Quadratic. Insertion sort's running time is linear when the array is already sorted or all elements are equal.
         * With three possible values the running time quadratic. It is possible that the array is partially sorted or nearly sorted, 
         * which would reduce the number of comparisons and make the running time closer to linear.

         * and by rank within each suit, with the restriction that cards must be laid out face down in a row, 
         * and the only allowed operations are to check the values of two cards and to exchange two cards (keeping them face down).
         *

         * I would use selection sort, comparing the cards first by suit, and if they have the same suit, by rank.
         * As we are dealing with physical objects it makes sense to minimize the number of swaps.
         * With selection sort it may be needed to look at more cards than insertion sort (twice as many in the average case).
         * 
         * The fastes way is to swap the card that has been looked at and put it in the respective place that card belongs in the deck.
         * This is a variation of selection sort, but achieves linear algorithmic time complexity.

         * 
         * 1. I would compare both top cards and, if the top card were bigger than the second card, I would swap them.
         * 2. I would mark the top card, so I could know it was the first card (in this iteration) sent to the bottom of the deck.
         * 3. I would send the top card to the bottom of the deck.
         * 4. I would repeat steps 1 and 3 until the marked card becomes the second card in the deck
         * 5. I would send the top card to the bottom of the deck (and the marked card is now at the top, signaling that a iteration is over)
         * 6. If there were no swaps in this iteration, the deck is sorted. Otherwise, repeat steps 1 to 6.
