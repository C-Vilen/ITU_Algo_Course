The worst sequence I can think of is K/2 insertions followed by K/2 removals, since remove is the most expensive method in the class. 
The amortized cost per operation (counting both remove and insert operations) will then be 
âˆ¼ (K/2)^2/2 = K^2/4K = K/4, since the cost of the remove operations will dominate the running time as K grows. 
Thus, the amortized cost per operation must be linear in K.
